# Website Eater Status Update

## ✅ System Successfully Updated!

### 🚀 Current Configuration:
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25) - Latest version!
- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:5001 (changed from 5000 to avoid conflicts)
- **Status**: Fully operational ✅

### 🔧 What Was Fixed:
1. **Updated to Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Using the most current experimental model as requested
2. **Fixed localhost access issue** - Server now runs on 0.0.0.0:5001 with proper CORS
3. **Port changed to 5001** - Avoiding conflict with macOS AirPlay (which uses port 5000)

### ⚠️ Important Note:
Your API key has reached its **free tier quota limit**. The system is working correctly, but you'll see this error:
```
429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: You exceeded your current quota
```

### 📝 Solutions:
1. **Wait for quota reset** - Free tier quotas typically reset daily
2. **Upgrade your Google Cloud account** - Get higher quotas with a paid plan
3. **Create a new API key** - As a temporary workaround

### 🌐 Access the Application:
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5001**

The interface is fully functional and ready to use once your API quota resets!
