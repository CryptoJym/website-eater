# Platform Comparison for Website Eater

## Quick Comparison Table

| Platform | Frontend | Backend | Memory Storage | Difficulty | Cost |
|----------|----------|---------|----------------|------------|------|
| **Netlify** | ✅ Excellent | ❌ None | ❌ None | Easy | Free |
| **Vercel** | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Serverless only | ❌ None | Easy | Free |
| **Railway** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full Flask | ✅ Yes | Easy | Free tier |
| **Heroku** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full Flask | ✅ Yes | Medium | Free tier |
| **Render** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Full Flask | ✅ Yes | Easy | Free tier |

## Why Website Eater Needs a Full Backend

Website Eater stores "memories" of processed URLs in memory:
```python
# This is in your app:
memories = []  # This needs to persist between requests!
```

**Serverless functions** (Vercel/Netlify Functions):
- Start fresh on each request
- Can't maintain state
- Would lose all memories after each call

**Full backend** (Railway/Heroku/Render):
- Keeps running continuously
- Maintains memory storage
- Can build up knowledge over time

## Best Architecture Options

### Option 1: Split Deployment (Recommended)
```
Frontend (Static) → Vercel/Netlify (Free, Fast CDN)
    ↓ API calls
Backend (Flask) → Railway/Render (Free tier, Always running)
```

### Option 2: All-in-One
```
Full App → Railway/Render (Hosts both frontend + backend)
```

### Option 3: Advanced (With Database)
```
Frontend → Vercel
Backend → Vercel Functions
Database → PostgreSQL/Redis (for memory persistence)
```

## My Recommendation

**Use Vercel for frontend + Railway for backend:**

1. **Vercel** (frontend): Amazing DX, fast global CDN, great analytics
2. **Railway** (backend): Super easy, GitHub integration, free tier

This gives you the best of both worlds!
